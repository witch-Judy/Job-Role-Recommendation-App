"The chart shows that the number of students participating in Kaggle's Annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey has multiplied throughout the years. Therefore, we think it is because Machine Learning and Data Science are becoming more popular these days and attract many students to pursue their future careers in this particular aspect.","The chart shows that Sciket-learn is the most popular Machine Learning framework, and then there are TensorFlow, and Keras. And it also tells us that there is less and even no difference in the popularity of frameworks used over these three years.","It is interesting to see that the largest number of people use Python, because the data set comes from the questionnaire sent to users by Kaggle, and most people who use Kaggle do machine learning and data analysis. Python is usually used to handle this kind of problem.","The USA has the highest income among the countries. Then comes the European countries like Germany and the United Kingdom. Among the Asian countries, Japan has a much higher medium income than India and China.","Since many people are still students between the ages of 18 and 24, it is understandable that “Not Specified” has a high proportion.",The chart has verified our assumption which is with longer experience the salary get higher.,"The chat shows that most of the people who learn or work in Machine Learning and Data Science are Men. To be more specific, there will be less than 3 women in a group of 10 in these areas."
"Another observation is the number of other job titles, including Data Scientist, Data Analyst, and Software Engineer, decreased from 2021 to 2022. We conclude that the reason is the severe wave of layoffs after the COVID-19 pandemic all over the world.","This data analysis lets us speculate on the most popular use cases in Machine Learning. Moreover, we may recommend students learn more about these frameworks, which help them align with the real-world industry.",,,"Because the data comes from Kaggle's Annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey, it is not surprising that many people work in the industry of “Computers/Technology.”",,Another observation is that Japan has the biggest difference between the percentage of men and women. And it is quite abnormal compared to the other developed countries.
,,,,"Another observation is that when the age range gets older, more people get engaged in the “Academics/Education.” This may indicate the typical career path for software engineers and data scientists.",,"In most countries, the percentage of women participating in Machine Learning and Data Science is growing throughout these three years which we think is a good sign."
,,,,"“Accounting/Finance”, “Government/Public Service”, “Manufacturing/Fabrication”, and “Medical/Pharmaceutical” are the other four industries that most people are involved in.",,
